# hello-world2
I made an error in the first hello world so I am trying again.  The error was that I did not create the branch off the master.
People are complex.  Sometimes, what they say and what they do do not match. I like to use data about their actions to understand people's behavior in an organizational setting.  This data can help form hypotheses as to why behavior/words are divergent.
